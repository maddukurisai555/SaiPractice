Write a function that moves all zeros in an array to the end while maintaining the relative order of the other elements. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴
The array can contain both positive and negative integers, including zero.
